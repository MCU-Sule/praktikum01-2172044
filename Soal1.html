    <hr>

    <center> <p><strong>We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes, <br>
        But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes. <br>
        One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, <br>
        Yet the plural of moose should never be meese. <br>
        You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice, <br>
        Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice. <br>
    
    </p>
    <p> <u>If</u> the plural of man is always called men, <br>
        Why shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen? <br>
        <u>If</u>  I speak of my foot and show you my feet, <br>
        And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet? <br>
         <u>If</u>  one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, <br>
        Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth?</strong>  </p>

    <p>Then one may be that, and three would be those, <br>
        Yet hat in the plural would never be hose, <br>
        And the plural of cat is cats, not cose. <br>
        We speak of a brother and also of brethren, <br>
        But though we say mother, we never say methren. <br>
        Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him, <br>
        <del> But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!</del> </p></center>
